# Keystroke-Velocity
# Blindfold Typing Challenge ‚å®Ô∏è

A minimalist and modern typing game designed for the ACES Club, with a unique "blindfold" twist. This web application provides a fun and challenging way to improve typing speed and accuracy.

## Features ‚ú®

**Clean & Responsive UI**: A sleek, dark-themed interface with animated gradient text effects and full-screen video backgrounds.

**Blindfold Mechanics**: A classic typing challenge where typed characters are overlaid on the original text, allowing for real-time error correction.

**Timed Challenges**: Users face a 30-second timer to complete a randomly selected sentence. ‚è≥

**Performance Metrics**: After each round, a detailed stats page displays:
- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Your typing speed. üöÄ
- **Accuracy**: A circular progress bar showing the percentage of correct keystrokes. üéØ
- **Unique Animal Ranks**: A fun, non-offensive animal name is awarded based on your performance. üêæ

**Seamless Navigation**: Easy transitions between a loading screen, a home page, the challenge, and the stats page. ‚û°Ô∏è
